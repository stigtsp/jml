# script to simulate a bunch of servers...
# 
# each server loads "jml.state" file then an individual unique file, one server per file is started.
# To add one:
#
#   ./mkserver Servers/NEWSERVERNAME.state
#
echo "--- servers running: killing ---"
ps -efd | grep -i ./jml | grep -v grep
killall ./jml

echo "--- servers starting ---"
ls -1 Servers/* | xargs -L1 ./server-start

echo "--- servers started ---"
ps -efd | grep -i ./jml | grep -v grep
